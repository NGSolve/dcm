This book is designed to provide an introduction and examples to the implementation of the Dual Cell Method in the high-order finite element library [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org).


The *Dual Cell Method* (DCM) is a Galerkin Method for the simulation of time-domain waves (e.g., electromagnetic or acoustiv waves) in mixed formulation. It is a Disconitinuous Galerkin variant where the two wave-fields are approximated by conforming functions on meshes dual to each other. Thus the respective ansatz functions feature discontinuities on different element boundaries.

For a full mathematical introduction to the method we refer to {cite}`WKCS2023,KCS2021`.
